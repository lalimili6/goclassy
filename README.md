An asynchronous concurrent pipeline for classifying [Common Crawl](http://commoncrawl.org/) based on [fastText's pipeline](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastText/tree/master/crawl).

For more info see our paper [here](http://corpora.ids-mannheim.de/CMLC7-final/CMLC-7_2019-Oritz_et_al.pdf).

If you want to download OSCAR you can do it [here](https://team.inria.fr/almanach/oscar/).

**Note:** For the moment the downloader part of the pipeline is not available as it is still experimental, it will be open sourced in a future release.
